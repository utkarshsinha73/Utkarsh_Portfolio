      <description>Extracted amazon user data from SQL database on Kaggle using SQLite3.
  Ratings were integers in the range 1 to 5. All ratings below 3 were classified as negative and above 3 as positive. Reviews with rating 3 were removed.
  Class distribution was analysed and data was found to be imbalanced with more number of positive reviews.     Duplicate review rows were deleted ( about 30% of data).</description>

  Analysed the class distribution and decided on log-loss as performance metric due to imbalanced data.
      Extracted some basic features like number of common words and advanced features using fuzzy string matching and TFIDF Word2Vec.
  Visualised common words present in most duplicate and non-duplicate question pairs with word clouds.</description>
