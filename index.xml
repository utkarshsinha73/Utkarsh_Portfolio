      <description>Extracted amazon user data from SQL database on Kaggle using SQLite3.
  Ratings were integers in the range 1 to 5. All ratings below 3 were classified as negative and above 3 as positive. Reviews with rating 3 were removed.
  Class distribution was analysed and data was found to be imbalanced with more number of positive reviews.     Duplicate review rows were deleted ( about 30% of data).</description>
